# Gradient-Boosting-for-Sales-and-Inventory-Forecasting
This project uses Gradient Boosting to forecast e-commerce sales and inform inventory decisions. After preprocessing and model comparison, Gradient Boosting achieved strong generalization. Sales predictions were then used in a simulation framework to identify inventory levels that maximize profit.
